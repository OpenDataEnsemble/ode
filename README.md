## Overview

ODE provides a complete solution for mobile-first data collection, designed to operate seamlessly in offline environments while maintaining robust synchronization capabilities. The platform emphasizes interoperability, extensibility, and a clean developer experience.

## Core Components

### Formulus

A mobile-first form engine built on [JSONForms](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms), optimized for field usability and offline operation. Formulus delivers an intuitive interface for data collection across Android and iOS devices.

### Synkronus

The synchronization layer and backend API, engineered for offline resilience and seamless data flow. Synkronus handles data synchronization, storage, and provides the backbone for all data operations across the platform.

### CLI & Development Tools

Command-line utilities and development tools to help you develop, test, and manage your data collection workflows. Includes utilities for custom app data management, user administration, and data export capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Open Source & Community-Driven**: Built with transparency and community collaboration at its core
- **Field-Optimized**: Designed specifically for real-world field constraints and challenging environments
- **Interoperable & Extensible**: Built on open standards with a modular architecture for easy extension
- **Developer-Focused**: Clean APIs and comprehensive tooling for a superior development experience
- **Offline-First**: Robust offline capabilities with reliable synchronization when connectivity is restored
